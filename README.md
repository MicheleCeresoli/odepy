This is a small suite of **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** Runge-Kutta solvers for Python that leverages [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) to minimise integration times, outperforming well established libraries like [SciPy](https://scipy.org/). Additionally, odepy's integrator capability to be called within numba-decorated functions allows the optimisation and decoration of much larger portion of codes.

Each of the available Runge-Kutta solvers comes with a dedicated dense output interpolant: 
  1. **BS5** - Bogacki-Shampine 5/4 method (lazy 5th order interpolant).
  2. **DOP853** - Hairer's 8/5/3 adaptation of the Dormand-Prince method (7th order interpolant)
  1. **Vern7** - Verner's "Most Efficient" 7/6 method (lazy 6th order interpolant).
  2. **Vern8** - Verner's "Most Efficient" 8/7 method (lazy 7th order interpolant).  
  3. **Vern9** - Verner's "Most Efficient" 9/8 method (lazy 8th order interpolant).
